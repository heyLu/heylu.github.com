# Hello.

i am lu and i love many things. you've found my little place on the web,
so below is a short introduction to the things you might find here.

## tech.

i'm a software developer. i tell computers what to do all day, but in
turn they also get to tell me many things. i'm always learning and i
hope that doesn't end.

specifically, i'm interested in making computers better for people. that
journey makes me do anything from [teaching][], doing all kinds of
[projects][] to investigating the ideas of functional programming as one
way to bring it closer to people.

i'd like to write software for you (yes you). if you have smallish thing
that's been nagging for month, [this][] might be something of interest.

i'm also interested in working with inspiring people, so you can also
[talk to me](mailto:lu@papill0n.org?subject=collaboration) about that.

## love.

i like the small things, the unexpected smiles from strangers, cooking,
having the time and space to think and [the][music] [usual][movies]
[suspects][linkage].

## more.

there's always more.

the internet has a lot of interesting [people][], i [fail][] (and/or
struggle) a lot, i like asides, [schaukeln][], words and all kinds of
things that change me.

also, drawing, too many ideas and you are wonderful.

## fin.

i love talking about things, so don't hesitate to [come](irc://irc.papill0n.org/lobby)
and [talk about](mailto:lu@papill0n.org?subject=hi) stuff.
