title: See you in a few years
layout: post

Almost every time I see someone make a promise, outline a big plan or
announce a new project, I want to see how it plays out. But in the age
of crowdfunding and rapid technological change very few people seem to
look beyond what's happening now or reflect on how such a promise has
played out.

I think there are two problems related to this:

1. a short attention span, e.g. being accustomed to just paying
   attention to something that's happening right now and not days, weeks
   or months in the future
2. no technology to track such things

Of course, there is the [PredictionBook][], but it's for predictions, not
for tracking progress of projects. What I'd expect from a technology to
track such things is something more data-oriented, on top of which
predictionbook could be built.

To track such progress over years we'd have to register them somewhere
else than in our minds & browser bookmarks and be reminded to check on
them later. And if we want to learn something about them we'd also
attach some data to those projects over time, such as estimated success,
goals already reached and finally whether they failed or succeeded.

But I won't build that technology now, I'd just like to point out a few
projects I am interested in and that I want to check back on in a few
weeks, months or years.

## Where will you be?

* innovative technology
    * [LightTable][], interesting new ideas about what an editor/ide should
      do and how it should work.
    * [NoFlo][], flow-based programming for JavaScript
    * [Datomic][], the database as a value
* web technology
    * [AngularJS][], one "popular" client-side framework in JavaScript. You
      could also pick any of [TodoMVC][], but this one is sponsored by
      Google and hyped right now, so it will be interesting to see where
      it will stand in the future
    * [Meteor][], a JavaScript framework that seemlessly integrates client
      and server-side parts. It doesn't seem to care much about URLs and
      APIs, but you can [build a chat][meteor-chat] very quickly in it.
      Some people believe it will [supplant Rails][m+], others [don't][m-]
    * [Pedestal][], a web-framework written in Clojure(-Script) that tries
      to bring a Clojure-inspired vision of programming/thinking to web
      applications
* games
    * [Limit Theory][], an ambitious procedurally generated space
      simulation, with interesting ideas about ai, procedural generation
      and software development. The author publishes a detailed, daily
      [development log][lt-devlog]
    * [Sui Generis][], a beautiful RPG with a sophisticated physics engine
      (realistic combat), probably generated terrain and some
      interesting ideas about gameplay

There are a lot of other things I'd like to track, here are a few
examples:

* usage & success of gesture control (for example [LeapMotion][])
* [self-assembling robots][]
* big gaming projects like [Star Citizen][]
* fate of [YCombinator][] startups
* how the [NSA surveillance revelations][nsa-files] affect usage of web
  services over time, in Europe and elsewhere

And many more things, but I won't do that. Probably if I write something
that lets me handle it easier or when I do start using [PredictionBook][].

We'll see.
