websites as services

information should be free, we should be able to take it and transform it
to create something else, to express our thoughts freely. we can do that,
by copying and pasting text around, taking screenshots, taking photographs,
recording sound... but it is not "native" to our lifes with technology
today.

usually we don't remix youtube videos, we don't post custom collections of
photographs, we don't remix articles. at most we share, we might quote an
article on twitter or if we're feeling good we might write a blog post
with a few links in it. but it's "difficult", usually we don't really do it,
for the most part we have degraded in a state where we're ok with consuming
most of the time, at most using a glorified form to submit our opinions.
and we don't control them, they can be deleted at will if they don't comply
with some set of arbitrary rules lawyers designed to protect their
company from any kind of problem.

yes, yes, we might create memes - by putting text on a mostly fixed set of
images. yes, we can create our own youtube videos.

but. it's so static, so almost lifeless, so very similar. why don't we go
explore our own path a bit more, why don't we go and make videos about
thin...

ok, well. i'm disappointed at how we interact with "web services", how we
mostly consume them, how that is the status quo. but how should we
interact, what should change, what would be different?

websites wouldn't quite exist anymore, they would be the default interface,
but most of us would have built our own that suits us best. doing that isn't
difficult, it's part of learning to use computers and mostly involves
learning a few concepts (activity streams, types of content, tags, collections
of posts/media) and deciding where content should appear and when.

websites would be services, that is they would provide a service, such as
video hosting and you would use it. they would provide certain actions, such
as uploading/adding a new video, deleting it, maybe adding metadata to it,
but not much more. for those actions there would be a simple interface, such
as a field where you drop in the video file or url, fields for the
information about the video and add/delete buttons.

another benefit would be the ability to link more specific things, such as a
still image of a video and parts of the video. sharing that link would mean
that others could start at that point in the video or do something with the
image or the part of the video, such as connecting it to an audio visualizer
or project it looped on a screen or apply transforms to it or apply face
recognition to it.
