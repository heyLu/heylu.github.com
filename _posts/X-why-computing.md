why i'm in computing

the short answer: i don't know. slightly longer: i persisted, i don't know
how, i don't know why, but somehow i got the idea that this is something i
can do. and now i've been programming/mucking around with computers for at
least 6 years, got a reasonably good bachelors degree and am thinking about
either continuing or getting a job.

i still don't know why i like it, but i know a bit more about what i like
about it and what i want to do. here's the part of the story i know.

- got started for real when i got a linux live distro. started writing shell
  scripts. before that i tried and failed to develop on windows with c++.
- delved into compiling software on linux, with a hazy dream of developing
  a better ui, possibly 3d, extending x.org. learned about c syntax, did
  small fixes while compiling x.org w/ dependencies and later all of the
  system, using LFS to built my own "customized" linux.
- also bought a c reference book, trying to cobble together programs using
  the functions documented there. dreamt of distributed something (search,
  i think, possibly other things as well) and a better package manager that
  could compile&make&install packages itself (based on the LFS system but
  better in some ways).
- got into ruby, somehow. played with ditz (file-based bug-tracker) and sup
  (quite an awesome email client). read _why's poignant guide to ruby somewhere
  along the line.
- switched distros a couple of times (after LFS), went from ubuntu, to fedora
  (until i was in university for a while, with gnome of course) to archlinux
  where i found a comfortable home until now
- started reading lots of blogs & essays about programming, picking up the
  notion that scheme would be enlightening, ruby was great and there were
  terrible languages like java & php (not entirely sure about the timing of
  the latter two).
- used blender at school. did my first svg+js project there aswell. first
  project where i had a detailed vision (colourful, on a big piece of paper)
  and realized quite a bit of it (presentation software that displayed
  everything in circles, didn't get to different  layouts, though).
- got into haskell. don't know why or how. tried to write a scheme interpreter
  (failed to do that in C before), got into compilers with simon peyton's
  book about it. pretty sure i also started read SICP, but stopped pretty
  soon. read learn you a haskell in a rush, stopping/failing at the monad
  chapter, but got the basics down.
- learned ruby on rails in a week to create a basic website prototype for
  a friend. read tutorial and wrote the app in parallel, even with tdd for
  most of the way.
- got into university, wasn't exactly good at the algorithm side of things,
  got them only "ok", theory wasn't my thing. math was this mysterious thing
  that i didn't understand
- got into gaming, including dreams of writing programs with it. lots of
  failed or only half-done projects, including a space shooter with a fellow
  student, some demos, a non-finished isometric zombie game in c# and an
  unfinished version of a procedural street generator.
- interested in unifying documents, or other things. worked on a html/pdf
  viewer and text-editor in vala for a university project. failed to come
  up with a real design.

- now i'm learning clojure, trying (or trying to try) to learn math and trying
  to learn how to think about big problems. many projects, including a feed
  reader (finally, reads feeds&twitter&hn&others) and an editable scene graph
  (where i didn't dare to think very far). got my bachelor's degree last
  week and have 1-2 months until i have to decide whether i want to do my
  master's degree or whether i want to/can work with awesome people and
  have a job.

patterns. i see a few. i just plunged through, even though i had no clue of
anything. for example, all the compiling or rather the error-searching when
things would not compile, which was all the time helped me searching for
errors, even now. and on the side, it introduced me to c, gcc, makefiles,
svn&git and quite a few cool projects.
i jumped in, no matter what. i just started and failed and then got on. i
didn't stop to consider things or think about what i should know, i just did.
that's also a bad thing, but it did me good. i think starting, making many
mistakes, believing the wrong things is better in this field than starting
and then noticing you can't do a thing and pondering that.
fearless. maybe i just didn't know what i was getting into, but i didn't
care how difficult something was, it didn't matter, i just tried (and
usually failed), but somehow i had fun and got further as time passed.
