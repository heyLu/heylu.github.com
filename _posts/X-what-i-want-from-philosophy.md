diving into philosophy

or the why and how of my interest in philosophy

i struggle with a lot of things, i think philosophy could help with some.
i'm not interested in theory, or rather i am interested in things that
help me understand/decide/cope with the things i think about. if they
lead me to explore theoretical foundations of philosophy, that's all
good, but i don't think i need to explore them to be able to discuss
philosophy.

thinking about it, i think i don't want to learn something about
philosophy, but rather how philosophers think, discuss the issues they
explore and how they structure their adventures into deep topics.

kind of like my recent interest in math/designing systems: i want to be
able to think like a mathematician and use the techniques to be better
at what i care about.

can i do that without diving into the foundations of philosophy? is there
a handy tutorial that exposes me to the way philosophers think?

from the wikibook it appears to be a lot about specific subbranches and
then first asking "what is <branch of philosophy>". that "what is ...?"
seems familar to me, e.g. to talk about what i want from a friendship i
need to know what a friendship is or at least what it is for me (which
might be very similar to what i want from a friendship. or maybe i should
separate the two? e.g. what it is for me is not exactly what i want it
to be? so maybe the difference is the difference between an ideal and
the reality? but aren't we talking about ideals all the time in philosophy?
how does "realism" influence philosophical discussions? do they care
about it or do they only consider ideals?)

heh, "philo",  "to love" or "befriend" and "sophia" "wisdom".

maybe it's similar to what i struggle with in mathematics? e.g. having
a problem and not knowing how to proceed? being intimidated, knowing or
assuming that the problem is too big to tackle in it's whole, but not
able to decompose it.
