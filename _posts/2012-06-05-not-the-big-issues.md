title: Not the big issues
---

I can't take on the big issues anymore, it takes the fun out of too many
things. That doesn't mean that I'll stop thinking about them, but I'll
put them to rest a little and focus on other (fun) things instead. It's
too much for me to sacrifice fun (and happiness) for desperately trying
to solve a problem.

However, I'm still very much interested in them and even more into other
people thinking about or proposing solutions to the problems. So, here
are the ones I can think of right now:

 * focused desktop environments (including a notion of projects,
     relations between documents)
 * software as information agents (helping the user make sense of data)
 * a document abstraction (web pages, pdf documents and code are all
     kinds of documents, why can't we even *read* them using one interface
     for them, yet? also, why can't we reliably link any kind of document,
     yet?)

Some inspirations (in no particular order): Tad William's Otherland,
LightTable, Smalltalk/Lisp development environments, ZigZag and probably
lots of other things.

If you're also thinking about some of these things or know
projects/people involved with these ideas, I'd be happy to hear from
you!
