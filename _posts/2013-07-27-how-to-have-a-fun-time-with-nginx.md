title: How to have a Fun Time with nginx
layout: post

I've recently have had a little bit of fun with nginx, but it took a
while to get acquainted. So here's a little guide to get you up to speed
faster. (Hopefully, if not, write me a love letter or something.)

In short:

* read the [wiki][]
* set `server_name` and restart (not reload) after changing it
* read the error log
* read other people's configs (I'll open up mine in a bit, in the
  meantime, there are some [on the wiki][samples].)
