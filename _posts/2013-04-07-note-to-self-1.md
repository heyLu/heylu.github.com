title: Note to self #1 (also, hi Internet)
layout: post
---

*I originally wrote this post last November (2012), but apparently
I havent't posted it so far. As I am now posting a whole lot of things,
I post this too.*

*It's actually quite surprising that some of the thoughts in this are
quite similar to more recent thoughts. I should read the stuff that I
write more often, not because I like my writing so much, but as the
second part of "reflecting".*

In no particulary order, a few things that could also be in my dearly
loved notebook (which misses me now):

* recent source of inspiration: The Shower. proof:
    - a game about being a cat, secrets and love
    - this and the next few posts
    - generally a whirlwind of ideas
    - ... (forgot some and The Shower dislikes my notebook)
    
    Actually, I think that this is a bit of a bad sign (no offence, my
    lovely Shower) because it means that I don't just let my mind roam
    around as often as I should.
    
    Sometimes, I just need to fade out all those things and zone out for
    a bit. Speaking of which... bye!
* do this *soon*:
    - publish this
    - work out independent domain, hosting and email solution
    - smile at more people just because (and for the betterment of ALL
      THINGS)
* advice from an expert (at something)

Oh..., hello again Internet, I've seen you all the time, but didn't
write that much. See, I did just start to remedy that, okay?

Also, be [nice](/2012-11-xx-things-that-make-me-smile-on-the-internet.html)!
