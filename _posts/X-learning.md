I'm learning.

- bachelor degree is coming close
- still so much to learn
- disappointed in a way
    - by my university
    - by myself
        - didn't search for peers to discover things with
        - didn't push myself all the time
        - "waited" for "something" to happen (vague dreams)
- still, a lot of things have changed
    - a few programming languages
    - mathematics is interesting now
    - i rediscovered teaching/sharing knowledge
    - going out of my way has been good

- i don't know for sure where i'm going to be
    - i want to learn (and learn with others)
        - mentoring?
        - projects w/ others
        - new technologies/paradigms/ideas
    - work or university?

- in hindsight, things i've missed
    - seek opportunities
    - sometimes exposing yourself works
      (if it's scary, it might be interesting/good)
    - working/talking/thinking with others is important
    - the big picture (goals, projects)
    - focus (thinking about thinking is difficult)
- most recently
    - not nearly enough "fun" projects
    - bachelor thesis was exhausting/difficult (different style of
      thinking, planning involved, trial-and-error only worked
      partially, focus w/o passion is difficult/impossible (?))
    - railsgirls, talking about math & philosophy
    - honest (painful) "confessions"
- next up? learning. deliberately. together.
