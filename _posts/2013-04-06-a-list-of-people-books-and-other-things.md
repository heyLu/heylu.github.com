title: A list of people, books and other things that influence/inspire me
layout: post
---

There are a lot of people that I admire, a lot of books that made me who
I am or changed me in a way and there are a whole lot of other things
that belong to me in some way or another. I think it is very interesting
to see what other people see as interesting or influential to them, so I
will write my version of it down.

Please note that this is just a dump of those things. I hope to put it
into some kind of database so that it can be read by programs, so that I
can organize it better and analyze it better. But this isn't for now.

And please also note that this document will change. That is a good
thing, as far as I am concerned, so please keep that in mind and ignore
any kind of date attached to this. I didn't get around to implement real
"timeless" pages here and I didn't do it for this little thing.

With that in place, here goes.

## People

* <http://stevelosh.com> (workflow, general "style")
* <http://cloudhead.io> (ruby (I think))
* <http://timelessrepo.com> (ruby community, interesting form)
* <http://paulgraham.com> (intro to lisp)
* simon peyton jones (compiler books, involvment w/ haskell, he's at
  microsoft research)

* <http://questionablecontent.net>, <http://jephjaques.com> (depression,
  weird & wonderful humans)

## Concepts

I note those concepts besides the things I associate them with, but I do
not really know where I picked the ones in this section up, so they'll
spend their time here. Thinking about it, it might be good to put all
the concepts in here, kind of like a "map of personal practices" for
thinking/living.

* it's my fault (think before acting, research/RTFM, think)
* encourage exploration/side projects/new ideas
  (<http://news.ycombinator.com> but mostly the faq or individual
  answers/interactions)
* criticism is a warning flag (most of the time)
* different things are important

## Books

* linux from scratch (general linux knowledge, compiling/packages, bit
  of C)
* why's (poignant) guide to ruby (best book about programming/pls)
* <http://learnyouahaskell.com> (second best book about pls, intro to
  functional)
* the implementation of functional programming languages,
  implementing functional languages: a tutorial (lambda calculus + transformations)

* thinking mathematically (you can do it, math is exploration/process,
  stuck is ok, reflect)
* how to draw with the right side of the brain (you can do it)

* Clean Code (is possible, makes the world/stuff after you better, from
  the start, codebase improves over time)

* Le Hérisson (depression, life has a point, friends, wonderful people)

## Talks

## Movies

* Le Hérisson
* Bridge to Terabithia (friendship, fantasy, dealing with death)

## Other

* <http://pinboard.io> (business model (+ trust, speed, non-bloat/focus))

## Recent things

I perceive them as influential, but I have experience these things only
in the last few months, so I am not yet sure whether the influence will
last.

* Apprenticeship Patterns (continuous self improvement, reflect)
* rich hickey
    * hammock-driven development (think)
