in a world where people routinely lie to each other, to people they are
supposed to protect, who can we trust? and how do we trust "the news" or
even "science"?

i read a lot of things these days, probably too much, but that's another
article. but in a lot of cases even though i'm interested in a topic i am
not qualified to say whether what is being written is correct. that's
true for most writing about politics, economics and science, the only
topic i am able to judge some of the writing is technology/computer science,
because that's what i've got a B.Sc. in. still, even in that area i don't
really understand a lot of topics, such as cryptography.

so, given this inability to properly almost everything we read at any
given day about any given topic and the tendency of people to lie to each
other, how can we trust what we read?

well, there are conventions for journalists, but they are being broken,
there are also laws, but they are being broken as well. the only people
that can judge something are the experts, and not only the one that might
be mentioned in the article, but ideally many opinions should be collected
to judge the credibility of an article.

what we need is a way to do this judgement in public. of course it already
happens, but without context. if i read an article and have questions about
it, i want to know where to ask and i want this knowledge to be public, not
just an answer to me. maybe we need a platform where experts can judge
articles in their area of expertise?

what would such a platform do? it would be a community (or multiple
communities) of experts in all kinds of fields, regular users (which may be
experts themselves, submit links to articles and categorize it and then the
experts in that field would judge the credibility of that article, point out
parts that are questionable or suggest further reading.

still, a problem remains: how do we know we can trust the experts? this is
the internet, after all, and of a published article you have at least an
expectation of journalistic or scientific integrity.

maybe it is a problem that can be solved by simply having enough experts
and if the majority doesn't think an article is credible or disagree about
something then there might be a problem with the article. by having enough
experts we could reasonably assume that someone would speak up.

still, we couldn't trust the article, so pointing to secondary sources
should be very important.

and maybe the advantage wouldn't be the "credibility rating" by the experts
but the discussion around articles, on a higher level than is currently
possible than in comments.

still, we don't want to give up anonymity because we want to hear dissenting
voices, we just want that they back their statements up, suggest alternative
sources and provide evidence. that sounds as if we just want a better
discussion culture, nothing else. it's just that it's difficult to force a
culture on people, especially if they can be anonymous.

so maybe such a platform would be useful, but it seems that the ability to
think critically, to do your own research and be familar with non-constructive
discussion techniques would be both more practical and more effective.

there you have it, we need to think more, again.

so, if you want to read some interesting articles and think about whether they
are reporting some kind of truth, here are a few that got me thinking more
about this topic:

* [When We Lose Antibiotics, Here's Everything We'll Lose Too][lose-antibiotics]
  and [Imagining the Post-Antibiotic Future][apocalypse-antibiotics]
* [Do We Live in the Matrix?][matrix]

And if you want to learn a bit more about discussion culture, particularly
about non-constructive discussion techniques, here are a few things i stumbled
upon:

* generally discussion "techniques" used against feminism
* a [list of logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/home)
