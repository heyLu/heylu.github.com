* everything as a platform, then people can build on it and do
  all the things you didn't think of (that's a risk if you're
  trying to do everything and aren't confident you can do
  anything valuable, but then with a platform you can kind of
  lock everyone in and stay relevant, though maybe only for a
  while)

some ideas

* thinking for programmers: sometimes (often) trying to solve
  a problem by sitting at computer and fiddling with things is
  the tedious way towards a solution.

    why? because it often works. but it takes a lot of time.

    how to fix it? by learning to think mathematically (or
    generally more structured/analytic), walking away from
    the computer, writing/talking about the problem.

    general techniques:

    - try/construct examples (especially for math), e.g. try
      examples in different situations, look for patterns
* note overlay
    - for videos: annotating presentations, notes (directly)
      on slides, changing with slide transition, additional
      notes "outside" of the video, permanent or changing
      as well
* learning to program: a bit, hell yeah, it's a useful skill
  and it will help you understand the world you live in.

    but "real" programming. mh. i'm quite undecided on that,
    but i kind of tend towards, "it might be not what you
    expect".

    the thing is: a significant part of programming (far too
    much, in my opinion) is just arcane knowledge that you
    acquire over years of struggling with kind of unnecessary
    problems.

    if those things would go away, then i would wholeheartedly
    recommend that you try programming if you're only remotely
    interested in it. it's fun, it's intellectually challenging
    and it's just awesome to see when your programs do those
    things you told them to.

    so it's important and interesting, but at the moment a lot
    of it is very tedious busywork. that's the real crime of
    our profession, actually: that we keep this awesomeness to
    ourselves, making it ever more complex, seldom bringing
    some of the power to users.

    i think that if we were to give that power, those new
    ways of thinking away, making it really simple to interact
    with our programs and systems, then things now unimaginable
    will happen, just because the diversity and different
    perspectives of the people who could program then would
    result in all kinds of things we can't imagine now.

    so, try it if you're interested, but it's not a "necessary"
    skill to have. at least, "running against walls" isn't.
    but the "thinking" skillset that underlies it all and that
    we don't use as much as we should, that's definitely worth
    learning & practicing.

    so, you might be better of studying math with a few friends
    for now, in a way.

    (but still, it *is* a lot of fun at times, so you should do
    just what you intended to do anyway.)
