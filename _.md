* everything as a platform, then people can build on it and do
  all the things you didn't think of (that's a risk if you're
  trying to do everything and aren't confident you can do
  anything valuable, but then with a platform you can kind of
  lock everyone in and stay relevant, though maybe only for a
  while)

some ideas

* thinking for programmers: sometimes (often) trying to solve
  a problem by sitting at computer and fiddling with things is
  the tedious way towards a solution.

    why? because it often works. but it takes a lot of time.

    how to fix it? by learning to think mathematically (or
    generally more structured/analytic), walking away from
    the computer, writing/talking about the problem.

    general techniques:

    - try/construct examples (especially for math), e.g. try
      examples in different situations, look for patterns
* note overlay
    - for videos: annotating presentations, notes (directly)
      on slides, changing with slide transition, additional
      notes "outside" of the video, permanent or changing
      as well
