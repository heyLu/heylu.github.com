a database for biases of people and organizations

an api for real-time messaging

("agents" that act on your behalf?)

the archive. a service that archives webpages.
	(minimal: images of pages, probably phantomjs+pandoc; what about
	other kinds of documents? maybe this should actually two services:
	one that stores content given a url, a timestamp and some data and
	another one that takes the images, extracts the text and submits it
	to the store.)
