a database for biases of people and organizations

an api for real-time messaging

("agents" that act on your behalf?)

the archive. a service that archives webpages.
	(minimal: images of pages, probably phantomjs+pandoc; what about
	other kinds of documents? maybe this should actually two services:
	one that stores content given a url, a timestamp and some data and
	another one that takes the images, extracts the text and submits it
	to the store.)

almost flying. a 3d free-runner without any obligations. you just explore. or wait for the sun to set. but you can run as much as you want. because it's fun.

flying around in space. this time with cities.

encoding the knowledge about the world as facts and querying it using datalog. would that be "enough" for complex behaviour? what would be missing?

tutorials focusing on concepts behind technology. (e.g "docker provides kind-of immutable os-level containers" and how it differs from other things, how that changes the way you use it)

i don't like cynics. i'm naive and full of hope.

warmth in tech. i miss it, so much competition, being "tough" (and knowing everything). can we have more weakness. that sounds quite fluffy, but so be it. and we can still have new things, unknown things, ideas from outer space... that's what i like people like simon peyton-jones, rich hickey and in general people that write: they're gentle, somehow. they don't look down on you because you don't know something, they're trying to explain it to you.

a system composed of services which interface with each other through data. the ui is composed of services itself, with different uis for the same data in different contexts.

talking to the google search bar (with suggestions). about the problems and worries we have, about surveilance, about friends, love and fear.

web applications are a ui for documents. it doesn't matter that they're "single-page" or something else, they're just a way to interact with the data (the documents).
