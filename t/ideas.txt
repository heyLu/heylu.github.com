an api for real-time messaging

the archive. a service that archives webpages.
	(minimal: images of pages, probably phantomjs+pandoc; what about
	other kinds of documents? maybe this should actually two services:
	one that stores content given a url, a timestamp and some data and
	another one that takes the images, extracts the text and submits it
	to the store.)

almost flying. a 3d free-runner without any obligations. you just explore. or wait for the sun to set. but you can run as much as you want. because it's fun.

flying around in space. this time with cities.

tutorials focusing on concepts behind technology. (e.g "docker provides kind-of immutable os-level containers" and how it differs from other things, how that changes the way you use it)

i don't like cynics. i'm naive and full of hope.
