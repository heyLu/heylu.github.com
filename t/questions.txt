# i have questions. and somethings. here are some of them.

avoiding/circumventing the filter bubble

making privacy the default

surviving the days until the next $FAVOURITE_COMIC update

what's category theory?

motivation in the face of obvious deficiencies. (e.g. learning to draw.)

tracking bias. via technology? crowdsourcing it (w/o corruption)?

what are the really innovative ideas for interacting with information?

extensibility. what approaches are there, how do we allow non-intended extensions, what's been done?

extensible web apps. if they're just javascript, why can't we extend them? or should they be apis with an optional frontend?

is it possible to maintain "civil" discussions on the internet without suppressing knowledge/opinions outside of our filter bubbles? (e.g.  filter out non-value adding, derailing people. but sometimes they do have a point and most of the times the decision whether someone "adds something" is very subjective. stackexchange does it by narrowing the focus, discourse by making moderation easier?)
