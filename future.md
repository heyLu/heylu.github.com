what if we actually started thinking about an interesting future
for personal computing?

- programming languages (less language, more manipulation,
  interaction and exploration)
- systems (too much energy is wasted on getting software to
  communicate, a system should be designed to do this from
  the start)

    * history lessons to be learnt from past system designs
- non-linear, non-organized by default, needs a flexible model
  and have tools to shape structure over time
- everything local by default, syncing is supported but
  additional independent part
- services, not applications (if such distinctions are even
  applicable)
- data at the core, ui is just rendered data, multiple
  possible renderings for pieces of data
- contextual knowledge is encodable/normal, annotations for
  everything (margin notes, synced to video/audio, on any
  kind of document/thing)
- search as an interface to new functionality (e.g. no menu
  searching, but filterable lists of things to do/actions)
- documentation as a core feature of the system, not something
  separate, shown in context, without "effort", first thing
  to learn when getting to know the system
- reification (if we have a type system, then we can ask things
  about types; if we have syntax, then we can parse/generate
  that syntax; ...) to prevent us from using a different system
  to change the system itself
- explorable, some kind of linking facility that works on system
  functionality, documents
- history tree/graph
