# A soon-to-be posts (hopefully)

If they don't turn out to be a post, at least post the research links.

Each idea should be (at most) one sentence. If I can't explain it in
less than 72 characters, then I'm doing something wrong.

## The list

* explorative, confidence-inspiring math exercises
* how `git blame` works
* displaying diffs in vim (before the line number)
    - [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)
* wonderful blogs
* a tdd'd web-based and gist/localstorage backed markdown editor
    - not tdd'd, but still kinda sweet:
      [chrome-newtab-notes](https://github.com/heyLu/chrome-newtab-notes)
* focusing (my little idea)
