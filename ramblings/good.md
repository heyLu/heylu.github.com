# Good

* finishing when deadline is near
* completing small incremental steps
* tech-dreaming in the shower
* ~laying out big plans

# Bad

* consistent work on a topic (bored, frustrated, distracted)
* ~focus (over long time, short-time focus works)

# Exploiting the good

* pressured finishing
    - make deadlines/failures public, talk about things (potentially painful)
* small, incremental steps
    - define lots of small steps (yet rewards don't work?)
    - track them to see how they add up (motivation, good/bad?)
