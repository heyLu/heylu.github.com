# Why I use open(-source) tools when I can choose.

When presented with a choice between something that is open and
something that is (in any way) closed, I'll always choose the open one.
Even if the closed thing is more convenient, a common choice or whatever
else may be in favour for it, I'll still choose the airy path.

There are a few ideas that represent the essence of what I am going to
say. They are openness in itself (as in open-source), the joy of being
able to do what I want (as in anything is possible) and the community
around it (as in the communities ;).

 * what?
    - own projects, fun technology, experimentation, learning
    - not about working/markets/or-anything-like-that
 * good
    - open-source (secure, less bugs, anything is possible)
    - community (a real one, choice; helpful; togetherness)
    - show-off own work, audience, feeling :)
 * bad
    - fragmentation, sometimes slow (consensus), sometimes 'behind'
    - choices, hackish/fragile/simply-bad-design
