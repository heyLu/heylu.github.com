# Kisses!

Oh well, now he's gone crazy. **Wrong!** I've been weird all the time
and you didn't notice it, so don't blame me. :)

Actually, I'd like to welcome you to this lovely place somewhere near my
mind. It's where I dump in things I am thinking about, I'd like to think
about or about which I am thinking to think about soonish.

Have fun!

## O 'rly!

Yes, it's quite real. The fact you're reading it kind of proves it.

So what is it about? It's a place for [me](cy://space) to talk about
things that I feel like talking about, to capture crazy ideas availlable
for others to see and generally a place to love.

And what *is* it? Kind of a blog, more of a log and largely
unstructured. It is a blog in that I write articles in it (never mind
those shortely micropost-like posts). It isn't because I don't allow
comments other to an email address and don't implement much else.
